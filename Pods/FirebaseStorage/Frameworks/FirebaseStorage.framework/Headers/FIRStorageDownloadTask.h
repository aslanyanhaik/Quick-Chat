/**
 * FIRStorageDownloadTask implements resumable downloads from an object in Firebase Storage.
 * Downloads can be returned on completion with a completion handler, and can be monitored
 * by attaching observers, or controlled by calling FIRStorageTask#pause, FIRStorageTask#resume,
 * or FIRStorageTask#cancel.
 * Downloads can currently be returned as NSData in memory, or as an NSURL to a file on disk.
 * Downloads are performed on a background queue, and callbacks are raised on the developer
 * specified callbackQueue in FIRStorage, or the main queue if left unspecified.
 * Currently all uploads must be initiated and managed on the main queue.
